                        I first began robotics in middle school, where along with a few friends I created lego robots to complete challenges across
                        a board the size of a table. It was my favorite activity all through middle school and so, I knew
                        I had to continue in high school. I joined with the intention of getting to program the 6 foot robot
                        to compete at the world competition but left with much more.

                        Motivated by my interest in entrepreneurship, I joined the business subteam. Over the past few years, I have lead the business
                        team to win the entrepreneurship award for our work. I manage our $140,000 budget, which we fundraise
                        for and allocate each year. I guide students in writing stellar sponsor letters to businesses; I
                        reach out to local business over the phone and in person for contributions; I manage the finances
                        of our events that cater to 1000+ people.

                        My first hackathon experience was at ProfHacks, where my team and I created Munch, a platform for restaurants to use their
                        wasted food by selling it at discounted prices. We created an all inclusive system featuring an app
                        for customers, a people counter, a restaurant dashboard and even an Alexa skill! I worked on detecting
                        the people entering and exiting the restaurant using openCV which we integrated with our firebase
                        backend. I also created the Alexa skill for customers to access nearby discounts. In this experience,
                        I worked with technologies perfect for a hackathon setting and we got the 3rd place prize!

                    <p>
                        I recently had my first significant experience with open source through a competition called Google Code-In. This is an international
                        competition open to all high school students where you work with one of their partner organizations
                        to support them with their development and live projects. I worked with an organization called XWiki
                        which is a software platform used by both individuals and organizations to enhance internal knowledge
                        sharing. So very much connected to the field that I want to learn and contribute in. In my first
                        few tasks, I scoured the Jira (bug tracking platform) issues and developed skills reading and debugging
                        code. I then tackled writing unit tests, eventually moving up to large projects. In all my experiences,
                        I developed the skills to rapidly identify faults in code and create working applications. The company
                        was based in Europe and so, I had to adjust to their time zone. I was loving the work and intended
                        to win, and so, I spent entire days over a two month period on working with my mentors on new projects.
                        Here, I gained collaboration skills and learned to work with people I hadn’t met before. I took on
                        this challenge because of a thirst for learning. I instantly recognized, correctly, that this competition
                        would be an amazing learning experience for me, and so, I was willing to sacrifice all my time to
                        improve my skills. As a testament to my learning, I was awarded the Grand Prize Trip to Google HQ!
                        (50 students chosen from 3500) Google Code-In opened the doors to new opportunities, introducing
                        me to the world of open source. I now contribute to open-source in my free time and even have my
                        own open source project.
