                        I first began robotics in middle school, where along with a few friends I created lego robots to complete challenges across
                        a board the size of a table. It was my favorite activity all through middle school and so, I knew
                        I had to continue in high school. I joined with the intention of getting to program the 6 foot robot
                        to compete at the world competition but left with much more.

                    <p>
                        Motivated by my interest in entrepreneurship, I joined the business subteam. Over the past few years, I have lead the business
                        team to win the entrepreneurship award for our work. I manage our $140,000 budget, which we fundraise
                        for and allocate each year. I guide students in writing stellar sponsor letters to businesses; I
                        reach out to local business over the phone and in person for contributions; I manage the finances
                        of our events that cater to 1000+ people.

                    <p>
                        My first hackathon experience was at ProfHacks, where my team and I created Munch, a platform for restaurants to use their
                        wasted food by selling it at discounted prices. We created an all inclusive system featuring an app
                        for customers, a people counter, a restaurant dashboard and even an Alexa skill! I worked on detecting
                        the people entering and exiting the restaurant using openCV which we integrated with our firebase
                        backend. I also created the Alexa skill for customers to access nearby discounts. In this experience,
                        I worked with technologies perfect for a hackathon setting and we got the 3rd place prize!

                    </p>

                    <h3>PennApps XVIII - Top 30</h3>
                    <p>
                        PennApps is an international hackathon held at UPenn. Over 1000 hackers join to work on awesome projects that often end up
                        being used in the real world. That said, this time, our team created something a little more fun
                        while learning some new technologies. Our team built Airtunes! AirTunes recognizes 10 different popular
                        dance moves (at any given moment) and generates a corresponding sound. The sounds can be looped and
                        added at various times to create an original song with simple gestures. The user can choose to be
                        one of four different superheroes (Hulk, Superman, Batman, Mr. Incredible) and record their piece
                        with their own personal touch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this, we trained a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow with 1000 samples of each gesture, which worked better
                        than manually calculating the angles between the hands and head. The model works with 98% accuracy
                        on the test data set. As for the UI, we designed it using the kivy library in python. There, we added
                        record functionality, the ability to choose the music and the superhero overlay, which was done with
                        the use of dlib and opencv to detect facial features and map a static image over these features.

                    <h3>Amazon Alexa Skills Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Alexa Skills Challenge was my introduction to Alexa and AWS in general. I built a skill called TestQuest. TestQuest allows
                        students and parents an easy way to access standardized test information. It features a variety of
                        intents ranging from asking for a deadline for a specific test to asking for test date recommendations
                        based on your goal score.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this, I built a web scraper to scrape data from the collegeboard and act websites so that I don't have to manually feed
                        in the dates. Then, I stored this data in DynamoDB so it is accesible to each user and can be updated.
                        I also experimented with different states and through this, I created a conversation flow rather
                        than a simple question and answer app.

                    <p>
                        I recently had my first significant experience with open source through a competition called Google Code-In. This is an international
                        competition open to all high school students where you work with one of their partner organizations
                        to support them with their development and live projects. I worked with an organization called XWiki
                        which is a software platform used by both individuals and organizations to enhance internal knowledge
                        sharing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my first few tasks, I scoured the Jira (bug tracking platform) issues and developed skills reading and debugging code.
                        I then tackled writing unit tests, eventually moving up to large projects. In all my experiences,
                        I developed the skills to rapidly identify faults in code and create working applications. The company
                        was based in Europe and so, I had to adjust to their time zone. I was loving the work and intended
                        to win, so I spent entire days over a two month period on working with my mentors on new projects.
                        Here, I gained collaboration skills and learned to work with people I hadn’t met before.

                        I took on this challenge because of a thirst for learning. I instantly recognized, correctly, that this competition would
                        be an amazing learning experience for me, and so, I was willing to sacrifice all my time to improve
                        my skills. As a testament to my learning, I was awarded the Grand Prize Trip to Google HQ! Google
                        Code-In opened the doors to new opportunities, introducing me to the world of open source. I now
                        contribute to open-source in my free time and even have my own open source project.

                        In the summer of 2018, I worked as the teacher at STEAMWorks, a company that hosts STEM programs for students of all ages,
                        which in the summer means summer camps. I taught classes ranging from woodworking to lego robotics,
                        picking up new skills myself in the process. I worked in an intensive environment, as I had to learn
                        new activities the week before I was teaching them. This environment helped me boost my own know-how.
                        Prior to STEAMWorks, I had never 3d printed a chess set, built and painted a wooden birdhouse, soldered
                        together a mini-bicycle.

                    <p>
                        It also gave me an opportunity of managing large groups of 15 to 20 students of various age groups, running 3 different lessons
                        at the same time. I used this opportunity to spread STEM in the community, reaching new students
                        every week.

                        This one is pretty long so here is a TL;DR: I ran sprinting in track → got moved to distance running → joined xc and broke 5 minutes in the mile
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                My freshman year of high school, in an attempt to remain active, I hesitantly signed up for Spring Track. The first season went well. I ran the 400m dash that I used to dread 3-4 times over the course of the season. I didn’t get to run in too many meets. Still, my goal of staying fit was in motion. Sophomore year, I joined track early in the winter and continued through the spring as a sprinter. I was still running the 400m and the 400m relays and I still longed for once in a while opportunities for running a shorter 200m race.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Then everything changed.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                My nonchalant attitude caught up to me and Coach Gould gave me two options: either be kicked out of the team or join the distance crew. I knew I wanted to continue to be a part of the team so I joined the distance team, and then began my real journey in track. I was terrified of the distance workouts. They were known to do their own workout, and then do what the sprinters did right after to maintain their speed.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                After training for about a week, I had my first race. It was the first time I did not jog the mile, the first time I sprinted not just to the finish, but during parts of each lap. I went from running 7 minutes in the mile to running 5:30.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                There was no stopping me from there. I knew I had to break 5 minutes and earn the “sub-club” title. And so, I signed up for cross country.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Cross country was another obstacle in itself. Some races, I would be standing at the start, already having given up. In those races, I would run high 20 minute 5k’s. One of the first lessons I learned from Coach Gould was to imagine yourself achieving your goals in vivid detail. After I heard that, I gave up on giving up. And instead, I would take out half an hour or so to meticulously plan and then visualize my race. It may sound silly, and you may approach running with a “Just do it” attitude but this method may have single handedly transformed my dream of breaking 5 minutes in the mile to a reality (spoiler alert).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Coming into Spring track, I was nowhere near my 5 minute goal. I had figured dropping 30 seconds in a year should be a piece of cake. A piece of rotten, spoiled cake, perhaps. I had actually gotten slower than last year. My first few races, I ran in the 5:40’s. I knew I needed to make some changes.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                I began logging my workouts in detail, leaving tidbits on how I could improve in the next one. I completed “dream miles” (1600m split up with rest) with teammates who I knew were faster than me. I remembered the method of visualizing races that I had conveniently forgotten when I was bombarded with work.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                And in the second last race of the season, I ran a 5:04. I had visualized a sub 5 race, and pretty much ran the splits that I wanted to, except for one moment when I gave up. In the second lap, I tripped and fell because of the crowd in the race, and for about 5 seconds, I convinced myself that I wouldn’t be able to break 5.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                For the final race, I visualized myself tripping. I saw myself persevere even when I fell down. And that was my moment! 4:57!

                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Track was influential because it sparked a period of personal growth. I saw concrete results from the work that I put in, which provided incredible motivation. In that personal growth, however, I found interests that I have come to value more than track, such as spreading technology through teaching and creating software that has a real world impact, so I did not run cross country this year.
